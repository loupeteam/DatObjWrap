# Description
The DatObjWrap library provides a simple, intuitive interface for opening and saving data objects.

Data objects offer power fail safe data storage. They have the advantage over permanent memory that they are also protected against battery failure. The DatObjWrap library provides a clean interface for the most common data object operations. Any state machines necessary to perform these operations are built into the library and do not need to be implemented by the application developer.

# Usage
The DatObjWrap functionality can be integrated into any project using a data structure and two function calls.

# Installation
To install using the Loupe Package Manager (LPM), in an initialized Automation Studio project directory run `lpm install datobjwrap`. For more information about LPM, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/tools/lpm.html
